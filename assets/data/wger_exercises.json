Make sure the rope length is adjusted to your height. One way to check is to grab both handles with one hand and stand on the middle of the rope hanging on the ground with one foot. If the rope (excluding the handles) reaches just below your chest, its length is right. A shorter rope would be hazardous, as you might hit yourself, and a longer rope would make for bad form.",

Repeat.\n \nComments\nThroughout lift, keep hips low, shoulders high, arms and back straight. Knees should point same direction as feet throughout movement. Keep bar close to body to improve mechanical leverage. Grip strength and strength endurance often limit ability to perform multiple reps at heavy resistances. Gym chalk, wrist straps, grip work, and mixed grip can be used to enhance grip. Mixed grip indicates one hand holding with overhand grip and other hand holding with underhand grip. Lever barbell jack can be used to lift barbell from floor for easier loading and unloading of weight plates.\nBarbell Deficit Deadlift emphasizes building strength through lowest portion of Deadlift.

    "description": "To execute the exercise, the lifter stands with their feet shoulder width apart and weights or resistance handles held by their side with a pronated (overhand) grip.\nThe movement is to bring the arms up in front of the body to eye level and with only a slight bend in the elbow. This isolates the anterior deltoid muscle (front of the shoulder) and uses the anterior deltoid to lift the weight.\nWhen lifting it is important to keep the body still so the anterior deltoid is fully utilised; if the weight cannot be lifted by standing still then it is too heavy and a lower weight is needed. It is important to keep a slight bend in the elbow when lifting as keeping the elbow locked will add stress to the elbow joint and could cause injury.\nA neutral grip, similar to that used in the hammer curl, can also be used. With this variation the weight is again raised to eye level, but out to a 45 degree angle from the front of the body. This may be beneficial for those with shoulder injuries, particularly those related to the rotator cuff.",

Your palms should be facing each other and your arms should be extended and locked with a slight bend at the elbows and the plate should be down near your waist in front of you as far as you can go. Tip: The arms will remain in this position throughout the exercise. This will be your starting position.Slowly raise the plate as you exhale until it is a little above shoulder level. Hold the contraction for a second. As you inhale, slowly lower the plate back down to the starting position.Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.",

    "description": "The body is then explosively pulled up by the arms in a radial pull-up, with greater speed than a regular pull-up. When the bar approaches the upper chest, the wrists are swiftly flexed to bring the forearms above the bar. The body is leaned forward, and the elbows are straightened by activating the triceps. The routine is considered complete when the bar is at the level of the waist and the arms are fully straight.\nTo dismount, the arms are bent at the elbow, and the body is lowered to the floor, and the exercise can be repeated.\nAs a relatively advanced exercise, muscle-ups are typically first learned with an assistive kip. The legs swing (kip) up and provide momentum to assist in the explosive upward force needed to ascend above the bar. More advanced athletes can perform a strict variation of the muscle-up which is done slowly, without any kip. This variation begins with a still dead hang and uses isometric muscle contraction to ascend above the bar in a slow, controlled fashion.",

All you need is a 5 or 10 pound weight plate, a strong thin rope about 3 feet long and a 6-8 inch stick or bar. Securely fasten the rope to the middle of the bar/stick and tie the other end of the rope to the weight plate. To begin this exercise, grab the bar/stick with both hands using an overhand grip. Extend both arms straight out in front of you, parallel to the floor. Next, roll the weight up from the floor by rapidly twisting the bar/stick with your hands and wrists. Once the weight reaches the top, slowly lower the plate back to the floor by reversing the motion of your hands and wrists. Repeat (if you can!).",

To perform a decline push-up, elevate your feet on an elevated surface, such as a bench, chair, or step, while placing your hands on the ground in a push-up position. Lower your body towards the ground while maintaining a straight line from your shoulders to your ankles, and then push back up to the starting position.\n\nUnlike the inclined push-up, the decline push-up places more emphasis on the shoulders and triceps, while still engaging the chest muscles to a lesser extent. By elevating your feet, you increase the difficulty of the exercise by placing more weight on your upper body, forcing your shoulders and triceps to work harder to push your body back up. The decline push-up can be a great way to challenge your upper body strength and improve your ability to perform other push-up variations. As with any exercise, be sure to use proper form and start with a height that is appropriate for your strength and fitness level.",

To perform a parallettes push-up, assume a push-up position with your hands on the parallettes and your feet on the ground. Lower your body towards the ground while keeping your elbows close to your sides, and then push back up to the starting position.\n\nParallettes push-ups place more emphasis on the chest and shoulders compared to traditional push-ups, as they allow for a greater range of motion in the shoulder joint. This increased range of motion can also help to improve shoulder stability and mobility. Additionally, parallettes push-ups engage the core muscles more than traditional push-ups, as the instability of the parallettes requires greater activation of the core muscles to maintain proper form.\n\nThe added challenge of balancing on the parallettes also requires greater upper body strength and control, making parallettes push-ups a more advanced variation of the traditional push-up. They can be a great way to challenge yourself and add variety to your upper body workout routine. As always, be sure to use proper form and start with a level that is appropriate for your strength and fitness level.",

    "description": "This exercise is somewhat similar to a cable curl and a cable crossover. But instead of a chest/biceps exercise, this exercise targets the brachialis muscle, responsible for that broad arm when viewed from a front view.\nDuring the exercise, maintain a pronated forearm position with starting position of approx. 45 degree pronated. Start with slightly bend elbows and alternately curl until your hands (your thumb first) meet your upper middle chest (similar to how Kong hits his chest, thus the name of this exercise).",

    "description": "Drop curls in a modified position at a slow pace effectively engage the brachialis for arm width.\n\nStarting position is with both arms in a slight angle towards each other at chest height with a dumbbell in each hand. Lower one dumbbell close to full extended arm position slowly and in a controlled manner during the first half of the curl, then curl it back up to starting position, while the other dumbbell stays at its starting position. Now lower the other dumbbell down. This keeps tension on the brachialis. As we pass the 90deg mark on our way down, the biceps will take over the work.",

    "description": "Overhead Triceps Extension with EZ Bar – Quick GuideThe overhead position emphasizes the long head of the triceps (because it's stretched under load), the exercise does engage all three triceps heads (long, lateral, and medial) to some degree during extension.Setup:\n Sit on a bench (or stand) and hold an EZ bar with a narrow, overhand \ngrip. Lift the bar overhead, arms fully extended. Keep your core tight \nand elbows close to your head.Execution:\n Slowly lower the bar behind your head by bending your elbows until they\n reach ~90°. Keep elbows pointed forward (not flaring out).Finish: Extend your arms back up to the starting position, squeezing your triceps at the top.Tips:Control the movement to avoid straining your shoulders.Use a moderate weight for full range of motion.Keep your back straight and avoid arching.",
